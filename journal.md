# Introduction 
Bloggs el at have researched into (Bloggs et al 2012)  this area extensively but they yad yada 
We used an aerosol spectometer to mmeasure  (Alen el at 2004)

# Simulations 
We ran an atmosphheric model to simulate formations of particles 

# Results
We expected something different

# Instrumentation 
The Aerosol Mass spectometer is described in Allen et tu 2003


# Conclusions 
We have made great inroads to understanding the mechanism of particle formation. 
# Results 
Our simulations did a good job of reproducing the measures. This means we think we understant whats going on. This addresses question X from the introduction.

# figures
This section contains the figures cause it is still a draft

#Acknoledgements 
I want to thank the funding body
